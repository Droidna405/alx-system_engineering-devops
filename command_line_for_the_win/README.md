# Command Line Challenge
# File Transfer from Local Machine to Sandbox via SFTP

## Prerequisites

1. **Access to Local Machine**:
   I had access to my Kali linux Virtual Machine that has the files
   I want to transfer on my local machine.
2. **Access to Sandbox**: I endured that I had the necessary credentials
   (hostname, username, and password) to connect to the sandbox via SFTP.
   i.e.  sftp ab758b910f7e@ab758b910f7e.c796e532.alx-cod.online

## Steps

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**:
   Opened my terminal or command prompt on my local machine.

2. **Connect to Sandbox via SFTP**:
   ```bash
   sftp username@sandbox_hostname i.e.
   sftp ab758b910f7e@ab758b910f7e.c796e532.alx-cod.online
   disclaimer - I won't share the password because of this project.

3. Once this was done I went to my local machine to finish the
   tasks while saving them on a directory of my choosing.

4. I uploaded the screenshots using the command "put <filename>".
